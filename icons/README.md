# Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

For now, placeholder icons are needed. You can create simple icons or use online icon generators.

The icons should represent a password manager or security theme (lock, key, shield, etc.).
