# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to view and edit credential passwords in plain text after providing their master password for verification. Currently, passwords are always masked with asterisks for security, but users need the ability to see actual passwords when editing or viewing credentials.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the actual password when I click the eye (view) button, so that I can copy or verify the password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user clicks the eye button on a credential THEN system SHALL prompt for master password verification
2. WHEN user enters correct master password THEN system SHALL display the actual password in plain text
3. WHEN user enters incorrect master password THEN system SHALL show error message and keep password masked
4. WHEN password is revealed THEN eye button SHALL change to indicate password is visible
5. WHEN user clicks eye button again THEN password SHALL be masked again without requiring master password

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see and edit the actual password when I click the edit button, so that I can modify credential details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user clicks edit button on a credential THEN system SHALL prompt for master password verification
2. WHEN user enters correct master password THEN system SHALL open edit form with actual password visible
3. WHEN user enters incorrect master password THEN system SHALL show error message and not open edit form
4. WHEN edit form is open THEN password field SHALL show actual password in plain text
5. WHEN user saves changes THEN system SHALL encrypt and store the updated credential

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the master password verification to be secure and temporary, so that my credentials remain protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN master password is verified THEN verification SHALL be valid for current session only
2. WHEN popup is closed and reopened THEN master password verification SHALL be required again
3. WHEN master password verification fails 3 times THEN system SHALL lock the interface temporarily
4. WHEN master password is entered THEN it SHALL be cleared from memory immediately after verification
5. WHEN password is revealed THEN it SHALL automatically mask again after 30 seconds of inactivity

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback about password visibility state, so that I know when passwords are visible or masked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN password is masked THEN eye button SHALL show "show password" icon
2. WHEN password is visible THEN eye button SHALL show "hide password" icon  
3. WHEN password is being revealed THEN system SHALL show loading indicator
4. WHEN master password verification fails THEN system SHALL show clear error message
5. WHEN password auto-masks after timeout THEN system SHALL show brief notification
